    <p>Hello everyone, I'm grateful to be in this class with y'all.
    I am from Dillon which is a small town in Montana about two hours
    north of Rexburg. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer science
    with an emphasis in machine learning. I'm far enough along in my degree
    that I now have to choose between functional programming and machine
    learning and I think machine learning sounds more interesting especially
    with all the new AI that has come out.</p>
    
    <p>One of my favorite things to do is play tennis, and so if you or
    anyone you know plays, hit me up! I also enjoy other outdoor activities
    like dirtbiking and fishing in the mountains. Indoors I like to play board
    games, video games, and chill with my buddies.</p>

    <p>My main goal and takeaway I want from this class is to be able to expand
    my personal project portfolio to be able to get internships/ jobs in the future.
    I love learning new coding languages!</p>
