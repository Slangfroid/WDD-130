            <p> This page contains various projects that I have created and worked on. I always am working on something new, and never feel like I have enough time to complete
                enough projects. The random quote generator below was one of the first projects that I completed that really made me proud of what I was able to do. I had done a
                lot of different coding projects in the past but the random quote generator was one project in particular that blew my mind I could make. For me, Making code that makes a
                clickable button was monumental. Something huge. I remember showing my mom and telling her, "Mom, isn't it insane that I can make a button on a website that generates a quote
                every time I press the button. Like, I did that!" The pride of my simple creation will always be a huge milestone for me. This is the joy that I find in creating things with 
                coding and I hope to have more experiences like this in the future. Another instance of a project that i really enjoyed working on is pictured on the left. It is an example of a 
                scatterplot matrix that I used to experiment with machine learning data. The blue dots are all true data points and the orange ones are false. This particular scatterplot was 
                made with seaborn and then I used sklearn models to train and test the data. Overall for the true data I was able to achieve 92% for the true data, and 93% for the recall. 
                For the false data I achieved 88% precision and a 86% recall. My overall accuracy was 90%. That translates to 276 false negatives, and 226 false positives. This graph is just a
                sample of what I have done with machine learning and I have big plans for what I am going to make in the future.

            <p class="quote-gen">This is the quote generator that I made on the right. I used Javascript to be able to make it have an event listener to generate a 
            quote when the button is pressed. Click it a few times and test it out! As you can see in general as of right now (2023) this page is
            fairly empty because I want to reserve it for personal projects that I made on my own. I have made a lot of projects so far in college, but I don't really
            count them as my own personal projects because we received a lot of instruction and were given most of the code for the projects.
