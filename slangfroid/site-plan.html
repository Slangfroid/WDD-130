      <p>
        Hello my name is Nathaniel Leonardson. I am from Dillon Montana and I am a Computer Science major at BYU-Idaho. 
        I have recently begun my emphasis in machine learning and that is where I believe I want to be in the Computer Science 
        industry. I have been interested in computers my entire life. In school I loved every excuse I had to go and explore new
        information and learn new things. Currently I am fascinated with artificial inteligence, working with big sets of data, and optimizing algorithms.
        I have found machine learning to be particularly challenging and fun. Challenging because there is always something to learn, and something to do better.
        Fun because you are always learning. I hope to always be in a position in life to be able to learn. Knowledge has become more powerful and important to me
        as I have grown older. During the course of college I have completed school projects with the following languages:
        Python (including altair charts, pandas, and seaborn), SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C#, C++, R, and Java.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        This page contains various projects that I have created and worked on. I always am working on something new, and never feel like I have enough time to complete
        enough projects. The random quote generator below was one of the first projects that I completed that really made me proud of what I was able to do. I had done a
        lot of different coding projects in the past but the random quote generator was one project in particular that blew my mind I could make. For me, Making code that makes a
        clickable button was monumental. Something huge. I remember showing my mom and telling her, "Mom, isn't it insane that I can make a button on a website that generates a quote
        every time I press the button. Like, I did that!" The pride of my simple creation will always be a huge milestone for me. This is the joy that I find in creating things with 
        coding and I hope to have more experiences like this in the future. 
      </p>

      <h3>Teamwork</h3>
      <p>
        I have learned that teamwork is one of the most vital parts of the Computer Science field. Time is not our friend, and a single person
        does not have enough time to accomplish major projects in the coding world. When you are working with another person the weight of
        the task is lighter and the speed at which you can accomplish great tasks is amplified. Below are just a few examples of different
        aspects of teamwork I have been involved in. I know what it means to be a team player. Resposibility and accountability are two major
        attributes that I try to incorporate into myself in everything I do, including teamwork. Out of all of the teams I have been in, the ones
        that accomplish the most and get the furthest are the ones that are more accountable and resposible. Communication, good leadership, and
        consistent effort all boost the accountability of every team member.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        All of the headers and footers for the following three wireframes will be the same, so I didn't explicitly put what will go where.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>         
        This page will continually be developed as more projects that I make will be uploaded to it.

      <h3>Teamwork</h3>
      <p>         
        I have made some changes to this wireframe. It was originally going to be my experience, but I
        changed to teamwork to make the content more relevant and more useful.
