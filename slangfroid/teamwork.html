            <p>I have learned that teamwork is one of the most vital parts of the Computer Science field. Time is not our friend, and a single person
                does not have enough time to accomplish major projects in the coding world. When you are working with another person the weight of
                the task is lighter and the speed at which you can accomplish great tasks is amplified. Above are just a few examples of different
                aspects of teamwork I have been involved in. I know what it means to be a team player. Resposibility and accountability are two major
                attributes that I try to incorporate into myself in everything I do, including teamwork. Out of all of the teams I have been in, the ones
                that accomplish the most and get the furthest are the ones that are more accountable and resposible. Communication, good leadership, and
                consistent effort all boost the accountability of every team member.

            <h2>House Construction</h2>
            <p>Sometimes teamwork is hard work. You have to get in the mess of things to get a completed product. It is easy to be the guy standing around
            with a shovel, but by choosing ease over work you are being detrimental to your team. It is important to recognize how important each individual
            hand is in creating. Even though my knowledge of construction was very limited while I worked this job, I still wanted to be a team player and get
            in the mess of things. The result was concrete and contentment.

            <h2>Tennis team</h2>
            <p>This is my tennis team my junior year of highschool. It was the first year in our school that both the girls and boys teams had won
            the divisional tournament in the same year. It was also the second time that our boys team had ever won a divisional tourney. What I learned
            that year about teamwork was the importance of our bonds together. I didn't do so hot that year in the tournament, but these teamates had become
            a family to me. I felt like I contributed even with the little skills I had. Everyone in a team setting has something to contribute.

            <h2>Divisional Tennis</h2>
            <p>Small accomplishments leade to bigger ones! We first had to play many long hard matches in the season that eventually led up to our huge state championship victory!
            We had to consitently hone in our skills throughout other competitions to be able to compete at the level that we did in our State Tournament. We also had to rely upon
            one another and trust that we would perform. In the end our synergy is what put us above the other competitors. It shows as well that two people can make a difference;
            Especially when you work together.
