            <p>I have learned that teamwork is one of the most vital parts of the Computer Science field. Time is not our friend, and a single person
                does not have enough time to accomplish major projects in the coding world. When you are working with another person the weight of
                the task is lighter and the speed at which you can accomplish great tasks is amplified. Below are just a few examples of different
                aspects of teamwork I have been involved in. I know what it means to be a team player. Resposibility and accountability are two major
                attributes that I try to incorporate into myself in everything I do, including teamwork. Out of all of the teams I have been in, the ones
                that accomplish the most and get the furthest are the ones that are more accountable and resposible. Communication, good leadership, and
                consistent effort all boost the accountability of every team member.
