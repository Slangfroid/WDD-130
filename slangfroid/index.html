            <p> Hello my name is Nathaniel Leonardson. I am from Dillon Montana and I am a Computer Science major at BYU-Idaho. 
                I have recently begun my emphasis in machine learning and that is where I believe I want to be in the Computer Science 
                industry. I have been interested in computers my entire life. In school I loved every excuse I had to go and explore new
                information and learn new things. Currently I am fascinated with artificial inteligence, working with big sets of data, and optimizing algorithms.
                I have found machine learning to be particularly challenging and fun. Challenging because there is always something to learn, and something to do better.
                Fun because you are always learning. I hope to always be in a position in life to be able to learn. Knowledge has become more powerful and important to me
                as I have grown older. During the course of college I have completed school projects with the following languages:
                Python (including altair charts, pandas, and seaborn), SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C#, C++, R, and Java.
