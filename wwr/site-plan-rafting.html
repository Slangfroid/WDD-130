    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this site is to promote our White Water Rafting business to get
    more clients. We believe that through this website our clients will be able to be informed
    and gain interest in white water rafting. We predict that the increase of exposure from 
    this website will increase our overall profit. Also on this website customers will find 
    the times, and be informed on if we are open or not. They will also have access to see
    any specials that we may have.

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The target customers for our business are college aged students or young adults
    who are seeking adrenaline boosting activities. They will most likely due to age not
    have a lot of money, so they will be selective in their decisions of the activities they
    do. We will be meeting their need for an activity that requires little to no effort on 
    their part, but provides a thrilling environment. The targeted access to the site will most
    likely be on mobile devices. Our goal is to stand out as a worthwhile adventure for the
    college students to take with their friends. We guarantee that our customers will have a 
    satisfactory experience that will be both fun and safe.
